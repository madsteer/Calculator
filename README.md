Stanford iTune-U iOS 10 Development using Swift
===============================================

Repository holding assignments and other code for iOS 10 using Swift from Stanford on iTunes-U

**note:** used xcode 8 at the beginning of the project and then moved to xcode 9.  Tried to maintain code base at swift 3 versus swift 4, but things may have got mudied along the way
